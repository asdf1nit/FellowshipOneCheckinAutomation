# FellowshipOneCheckinAutomation
Code base for Autoit Application that automates the Fellowship One Check-in app

This is the First version of my automation app. It works on Windows 7/8/10, and is configured either by an XML file or by passing parameters thru the command line. The code is heavly commented straight forward.
